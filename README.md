# Homework Assignment 5: Day Planner
---

## Description
This project is my 5th project deployed while taking the Web Developer Bootcamp at UNC.  It provides a fun approach at learning javascript by creating a day planner that allows you to put in new entries, save entries, it also highlights the timeslots by color based on current time you open it . All of this was created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap only.
